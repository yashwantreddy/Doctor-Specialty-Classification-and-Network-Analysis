## Doctor Specialty Classification and Network Analysis

For this project, I will try to correctly classify the doctors with missing/unlabelled specialities. The classification will be based off the NLP performed on their procedure description. As another milestone, I've performed complex network analysis to further classify the clustering of different specialties.

This is an early network cluster which I was able to model. The various colors represent different doctor specialties.

#### Data

Due to the confidential nature of the dataset, it is currently not included in my repo.

#### EDA

I've performed exhaustive EDA on the dataset and as a result,obtained several signs of sparse and dense segmentation of data.
